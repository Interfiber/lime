Macro creation tool for MacOs

## Why Does lime require accessibility?
Lime requires the Accessibility API to perform macro actions, such as pressing keys. Disabling accessibility will make lime a useless piece of software that does nothing.

## How do I use lime?
Lime is currently under heavy development, so I can't tell you how without updating this every day.
